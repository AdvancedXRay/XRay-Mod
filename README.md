- Press `G` to open the `selection & settings` Gui 

**Adding Blocks**

  - `From hand` *will set up the basic version of the block. So no axis, facing, etc*
  - `Looking At` *Will set up the complex version of the block, good for blocks you need specifc data from*
  - `Searching a list` *Like `From hand`, it will only setup a basic block*
- Set the Name, Color, and anything else you'd like to change
- Click add and Enable the Block if it's not enabled. You can enable and disable blocks by clicking on them in the Gui.

## Use on public servers

I **DO NOT** support the use of this mod on any public servers which do not allow this kind of mod. The mod **does** work on servers but I do not approve of, and will not, support anyone that attempts to use this mod on servers. I **do not** have the time to review each issue; I will simply close any issue with server connections in the crash log. 

If you wish to use this mod on private servers then that's on you. If you use this on public servers and are banned then that's on you and I will **not** support your use of this mod in that way. 

Join my Discord and ask about how to change the mod to use it on a server, if you can use it on servers or anything related, you will be banned without warning.

## A note on Optifine
Currently, the mod does not and has not work with Optifine since MC `1.7.x`. I am not sure why the two mods do not work 
together and due to Optfine being closed source I don't have the ability to investigate it properly. For now, I just recommend not using the two mods together. I hope to have it fixed soon. 

## A note on Minecraft Forge

As of Minecraft `1.20.5+` I am no longer supporting Minecraft Forge. I have moved to NeoForge as it a maintained, feature-rich, and more stable fork of Minecraft Forge. This will mean going forwards, this mod will no longer be usable on Minecraft Forge.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

## Game support system

I only support the last two major versions of Minecraft. For example `1.18` is the current (as of 02/2022) version of Minecraft, thus this is the First major version I support. The last long-lived versions of Minecraft was `1.16` and thus I will continue to support that until `1.18` is replaced by another long-lived version. At that point, I'll switch to `1.XX` & `1.18` for example.
